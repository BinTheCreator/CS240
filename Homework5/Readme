There are 3 main file which are wordCount.c, merge.c, and heapSort.c

---Descriptions---- 

wordCount.c: The program taking a textfile as an input and print out the content of the file, as well as the number of characters(excluding white spaces) and the number of words within the textfile.

merge.c: The program taking two textfiles and a new textfile name as inputs, and print out a successful merge message. It is ok if you did not create a new textfile before running the program. To check the content of the new textfile, run command: cat 'new_textfile_name'
